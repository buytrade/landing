# React Landing Page Project Instructions

This project is a modern React application built with Vite, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, designed for creating landing pages from Figma designs.

## Project Structure
- Components are organized in `/src/components/`
- Pages are in `/src/pages/`
- Assets (images, icons) go in `/src/assets/`
- Styles use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- TypeScript is used throughout for type safety

## Development Guidelines
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Optimize for performance and SEO
- Use meaningful component and variable names
- Keep components small and focused on single responsibilities

## Figma Integration Tips
- Extract colors, fonts, and spacing from Figma design
- Use Tailwind's arbitrary value syntax for exact measurements
- Create reusable components for common UI elements
- Implement mobile-first responsive design
